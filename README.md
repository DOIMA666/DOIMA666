👋 Hi, I'm Nhut Vinh Le Quynh

AI Engineer | Backend & Data Engineer
📍 Viet Nam

🎓 Studying Data Engineering at HCMC University of Technology and Education (HCMUTE)
🤖 Interested in RAG systems, LLM applications & real-world AI products

🚀 About Me

I’m an aspiring AI / Backend Engineer who focuses on building practical, production-oriented systems, not tutorial clones.

🔍 Strong interest in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🧠 Experience working with LLMs for fact-checking & information verification

⚙️ Backend mindset: scalability, modular design, performance

📊 Background in Data Engineering & Big Data processing

I believe code is not the goal — solving real problems is.

🛡️ Featured Project
Fake News Detection System

AI-powered Fact-Checking Platform for Vietnamese News

🔹 Problem: Fake news spreads fast, while manual verification is slow and biased
🔹 Solution: Automated verification using RAG + LLMs + multi-source evidence

Highlights

⚡ < 10s response time with 15+ trusted sources

🎯 ~92% accuracy on internal test set (200+ real claims)

🌐 Cross-checking from major Vietnamese news outlets

🔍 Transparent verdict with stance + citations

Tech Stack
